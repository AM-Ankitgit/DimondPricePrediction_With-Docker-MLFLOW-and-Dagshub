This ensures that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.\n"

    "\n",
    "`Building an Image:` You build an image from a Dockerfile using the docker build command. This process reads the Dockerfile, executes the instructions, and results in a Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Running a Container:` Once an image is built, you can run it in a container. Using the docker run command, Docker creates a container from the image, allocates a filesystem and memory, sets up a network interface, and executes the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Layered Architecture:` Each image and container layer is managed by Docker. Only the top layer of a container is writable, which helps minimize disk usage and image download times.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Sharing Images:` After building your images, you can push them to Docker Hub or a private registry, making it easy to share images among different team members or deploy applications across multiple environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Isolation and Security:` Containers are isolated from each other and the host system. Docker provides strong defaults, namespaces, and cgroups, which limit the amount of resources a container can use and what it can access."

    "\n",
    "# Performance\n",
    "`Docker Containers`: Near-native performance, faster start-up times due to less overhead.\n",

    "`Virtual Machines:` Generally slower performance and start-up due to the overhead of running a full OS and emulating hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Virtual Machines:` Strong isolation with a separate kernel, offering better security.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Storage and Size\n",
    "`Docker Containers:` Smaller image sizes, efficient storage with shared layers between containers.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Port Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "How Port Mapping Works\n",
    "When you run a container, Docker uses a private and isolated networking environment for each container. This includes a separate IP address, which is typically not accessible outside the host by default. If you have an application running inside a container, such as a web server listening on port 80, that port is only available to other processes within the same container or linked containers, unless explicitly mapped to the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Port Mapping\n",
    "Suppose you have a web server running inside a Docker container that listens on port 80. If you want to access this web server from your browser by using the Docker host's IP address, you need to map the container's port 80 to a port on the Docker host. Here’s how you would do that using the docker run command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -p 8080:80 some/web-app\n",
    "Here’s what the -p 8080:80 means:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8080: This is the host port. It's the port on your physical machine or Docker host. After running the command, the web server can be accessed on this port.\n",
    "\n",
    "80: This is the container port. It's the port your application inside the container is set to use.\n",
    "Accessing the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the above command, you can open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 or http://<docker-host-ip>:8080 (replace <docker-host-ip> with the actual IP address of your Docker host). This request will be routed to the web server inside the container on port 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Port Mappings\n",
    "You can map multiple ports by specifying the -p option multiple times in the Docker run command. For instance, if a container has a web server on port 80 and a database server on port 3306, you could map both like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -p 8080:80 -p 33060:3306 some/full-stack-app\n",
    "Port Ranges\n",
    "Docker also supports mapping a range of ports using a single -p argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -p 7000-8000:7000-8000 some/app\n",
    "Automatic Port Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t want to specify a host port and are okay with Docker choosing one for you, you can use the -P flag (capital P), which tells Docker to bind each exposed port to a random high-numbered port on the host:\n",
    "\n",
